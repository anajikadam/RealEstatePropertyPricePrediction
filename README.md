# Build Real Estate Price Prediction Model with NLP and FastAPI


## Business Overview
Our client is a Real Estate aggregator company that lists properties across the country on their platform. 
Property owners can enlist their properties in the platform, 
and the customers can directly contact the owners if they like to enquire about a property.

`The customers found that similar properties in the same area were significantly different
in price. They have contacted the support team and raised the issue multiple times.
This inconsistency in pricing is creating a lack of trust on the platform and hence the
company called us to build a price discovery and regulation model that would estimate
the price range of property given its attributes like area, apartment type, amenities, etc.`

This project involves building a regression model for price prediction, developing a web
application for the same using the FAST API framework, and deploying it on Localhost.

### Project Overview
To predict the price range of a new listed property based on attributes like area, apartment type, amenities, etc.
